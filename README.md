# AdventofCode22

This is a repo for my personal solutions of the [Advent of Code 2022 Event](https://adventofcode.com/)

The Goal is to train already in use programming languages.
Focus lies on: 
* PostgreSQL
* Go
* Python

Status Update: Unfortunately I did not keep up with the advent. But lessons can be learned. The current plan is to retrospect the written code and see where improvements can be made. This is done by my (hopefully) better understanding of coding AND the solution in the solutions published in the [Advent of Code Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/). Right now this is a low priority but might be relevant in the future.
